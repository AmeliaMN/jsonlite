Description: This package is a fork of the RJSONIO package by Duncan Temple
    Lang. It builds on the parser from RJSONIO, but implements a different
    mapping between R objects and JSON strings. The C code in this package is
    mostly from Temple Lang, the R code has been rewritten from scratch. In
    addition to drop-in replacements for fromJSON and toJSON, the package has
    functions to serialize objects. Furthermore, the package contains a lot of
    unit tests to make sure that all edge cases are encoded and decoded
    consistently for use with dynamic data in systems and applications.
Suggests:
    testthat, knitr
