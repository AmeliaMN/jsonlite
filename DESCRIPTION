Description: The jsonlite package is a JSON parser/generator optimized for the
    web. It started out as a fork of RJSONIO, but has since then completely
    been rewritten. The package offers flexible, robust, high performance tools
    for working with JSON in R, and is particularly powerful for building
    pipelines and interacting with web APIs. The parser implementation is based
    on the mapping described in the vignette of the package (Ooms, 2014). In
    addition to drop-in replacements for toJSON and fromJSON, jsonlite contains
    functions to stream, validate, prettify and minify JSON data, and many unit
    tests to verify that all edge cases are encoded and decoded consistently
    for use with dynamic data in systems and applications.
Suggests:
    testthat,
    knitr,
    reshape2,
    httr (>= 0.4),
    rjson,
    plyr
